# Simple Item Management REST API

## Overview
This project is a lightweight Java backend application built using Spring Boot.
It exposes RESTful APIs to manage a collection of items, similar to a basic e-commerce
backend (for example, product handling in platforms like Flipkart).

The application is intentionally kept simple and uses in-memory storage to demonstrate
core backend concepts without database complexity.
